			<p>On the evening of that day Vinicius, while returning home through the Forum, saw at the entrance to the Vicus Tuscus the gilded litter of Petronius, carried by eight stalwart Bithynians, and, stopping it with a sign of his hand, he approached the curtains.</p>
			<p>“Thou hast had a pleasant dream, I trust, and a happy one!” cried he, laughing at sight of the slumbering Petronius.</p>
			<p>“Oh, is it thou?” said Petronius, waking up. “Yes; I dropped asleep for a moment, as I passed the night at the Palatine. I have come out to buy something to read on the road to Antium. What is the news?”</p>
			<p>“Art thou visiting the bookshops?” inquired Vinicius.</p>
			<p>“Yes, I do not like to bring disorder into my library, so I am collecting a special supply for the journey. It is likely that some new things of Musonius and Seneca have come out. I am looking also for Persius, and a certain edition of the Eclogues of Virgilius, which I do not possess. Oh, how tired I am; and how my hands ache from covers and rings! For when a man is once in a bookshop curiosity seizes him to look here and there. I was at the shop of Avirnus, and at that of Atractus on the Argiletum, and with the Sozii on Vicus Sandalarius. By Castor! how I want to sleep!”</p>
			<p>“Thou wert on the Palatine? Then I would ask thee what is it to be heard there? Or, knowest what?⁠—send home the litter and the tubes with books, and come to my house. We will talk of Antium, and of something else.”</p>
			<p>“That is well,” answered Petronius, coming out of the litter. “Thou must know, besides, that we start for Antium the day after tomorrow.”</p>
			<p>“Whence should I know that?”</p>
			<p>“In what world art thou living? Well, I shall be the first to announce the news to thee. Yes; be ready for the day after tomorrow in the morning. Peas in olive oil have not helped, a cloth around his thick neck has not helped, and Bronzebeard is hoarse. In view of this, delay is not to be mentioned. He curses Rome and its atmosphere, with what the world stands on; he would be glad to level it to the earth or to destroy it with fire, and he longs for the sea at the earliest. He says that the smells which the wind brings from the narrow streets are driving him into the grave. Today great sacrifices were offered in all the temples to restore his voice; and woe to Rome, but especially to the Senate, should it not return quickly!”</p>
			<p>“Then there would be no reason for his visit to Achaea?”</p>
			<p>“But is that the only talent possessed by our divine Caesar?” asked Petronius, smiling. “He would appear in the Olympic games, as a poet, with his ‘Burning of Troy’; as a charioteer, as a musician, as an athlete⁠—nay, even as a dancer, and would receive in every case all the crowns intended for victors. Dost know why that monkey grew hoarse? Yesterday he wanted to equal our Paris in dancing, and danced for us the adventures of Leda, during which he sweated and caught cold. He was as wet and slippery as an eel freshly taken from water. He changed masks one after another, whirled like a spindle, waved his hands like a drunken sailor, till disgust seized me while looking at that great stomach and those slim legs. Paris taught him during two weeks; but imagine to thyself Ahenobarbus as Leda or as the divine swan. That was a swan!⁠—there is no use in denying it. But he wants to appear before the public in that pantomime⁠—first in Antium, and then in Rome.”</p>
			<p>“People are offended already because he sang in public; but to think that a Roman Caesar will appear as a mime! No; even Rome will not endure that!”</p>
			<p>“My dear friend, Rome will endure anything; the Senate will pass a vote of thanks to the ‘Father of his country.’ And the rabble will be elated because Caesar is its buffoon.”</p>
			<p>“Say thyself, is it possible to be more debased?”</p>
			<p>Petronius shrugged his shoulders. “Thou art living by thyself at home, and meditating, now about Lygia, now about Christians, so thou knowest not, perhaps, what happened two days since. Nero married, in public, Pythagoras, who appeared as a bride. That passed the measure of madness, it would seem, would it not? And what wilt thou say? the flamens, who were summoned, came and performed the ceremony with solemnity. I was present. I can endure much; still I thought, I confess, that the gods, if there be any, should give a sign. But Caesar does not believe in the gods, and he is right.”</p>
			<p>“So he is in one person chief priest, a god, and an atheist,” said Vinicius.</p>
			<p>“True,” said Petronius, beginning to laugh. “That had not entered my head; but the combination is such as the world has not seen.” Then, stopping a moment, he said: “One should add that this chief priest who does not believe in the gods, and this god who reviles the gods, fears them in his character of atheist.”</p>
			<p>“The proof of this is what happened in the temple of Vesta.”</p>
			<p>“What a society!”</p>
			<p>“As the society is, so is Caesar. But this will not last long.”</p>
			<p>Thus conversing, they entered the house of Vinicius, who called for supper joyously; then, turning to Petronius he said⁠—“No, my dear, society must be renewed.”</p>
			<p>“We shall not renew it,” answered Petronius, “even for the reason that in Nero’s time man is like a butterfly⁠—he lives in the sunshine of favor, and at the first cold wind he perishes, even against his will. By the son of Maia! more than once have I given myself this question: By what miracle has such a man as Lucius Saturninus been able to reach the age of ninety-three, to survive Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius? But never mind. Wilt thou permit me to send thy litter for Eunice? My wish to sleep has gone, somehow, and I should like to be joyous. Give command to cithara players to come to the supper, and afterward we will talk of Antium. It is needful to think of it, especially for thee.”</p>
			<p>Vinicius gave the order to send for Eunice, but declared that he had no thought of breaking his head over the stay in Antium.</p>
			<p>“Let those break their heads who cannot live otherwise than in the rays of Caesar’s favor. The world does not end on the Palatine, especially for those who have something else in their hearts and souls.”</p>
			<p>He said this so carelessly and with such animation and gladness that his whole manner struck Petronius; hence, looking for a time at him, he asked⁠—“What is taking place in thee? Thou art today as thou wert when wearing the golden bulla on thy neck.”</p>
			<p>“I am happy,” answered Vinicius. “I have invited thee purposely to tell thee so.”</p>
			<p>“What has happened?”</p>
			<p>“Something which I would not give for the Roman Empire.”</p>
			<p>Then he sat down, and, leaning on the arm of the chair, rested his head on his hand, and asked⁠—“Dost remember how we were at the house of Aulus Plautius, and there thou didst see for the first time the godlike maiden called by thee ‘the dawn and the spring’? Dost remember that Psyche, that incomparable, that one more beautiful than our maidens and our goddesses?”</p>
			<p>Petronius looked at him with astonishment, as if he wished to make sure that his head was right.</p>
			<p>“Of whom art thou speaking?” asked he at last. “Evidently I remember Lygia.”</p>
			<p>“I am her betrothed.”</p>
			<p>“What!”</p>
			<p>But Vinicius sprang up and called his dispensator.</p>
			<p>“Let the slaves stand before me to the last soul, quickly!”</p>
			<p>“Art thou her betrothed?” repeated Petronius.</p>
			<p>But before he recovered from his astonishment the immense atrium was swarming with people. Panting old men ran in, men in the vigor of life, women, boys, and girls. With each moment the atrium was filled more and more; in corridors, called <i xml:lang="la">fauces</i>, voices were heard calling in various languages. Finally, all took their places in rows at the walls and among the columns. Vinicius, standing near the impluvium, turned to Demas, the freedman, and said⁠—</p>
			<p>“Those who have served twenty years in my house are to appear tomorrow before the pretor, where they will receive freedom; those who have not served out the time will receive three pieces of gold and double rations for a week. Send an order to the village prisons to remit punishment, strike the fetters from people’s feet, and feed them sufficiently. Know that a happy day has come to me, and I wish rejoicing in the house.”</p>
			<p>For a moment they stood in silence, as if not believing their ears; then all hands were raised at once, and all mouths cried⁠—“<i>A-a!</i> lord! <i>a-a-a!</i>”</p>
			<p>Vinicius dismissed them with a wave of his hand. Though they desired to thank him and to fall at his feet, they went away hurriedly, filling the house with happiness from cellar to roof.</p>
			<p>“Tomorrow,” said Vinicius, “I will command them to meet again in the garden, and to make such signs on the ground as they choose. Lygia will free those who draw a fish.”</p>
			<p>Petronius, who never wondered long at anything, had grown indifferent, and asked⁠—“A fish, is it? Ah, ha! According to Chilo, that is the sign of a Christian, I remember.” Then he extended his hand to Vinicius, and said: “Happiness is always where a man sees it. May Flora strew flowers under thy feet for long years. I wish thee everything which thou wishest thyself.”</p>
			<p>“I thank thee, for I thought that thou wouldst dissuade me, and that, as thou seest, would be time lost.”</p>
			<p>“I? Dissuade? By no means. On the contrary, I tell thee that thou art doing well.”</p>
			<p>“Ha, traitor!” answered Vinicius, joyfully; “hast forgotten what thou didst tell me once when we were leaving the house of Pomponia Graecina?”</p>
			<p>“No,” answered Petronius, with cool blood; “but I have changed my opinion. My dear,” added he after a while, “in Rome everything changes. Husbands change wives, wives change husbands; why should not I change opinions? It lacked little of Nero’s marrying Acte, whom for his sake they represented as the descendant of a kingly line. Well, he would have had an honest wife, and we an honest Augusta. By Proteus and his barren spaces in the sea! I shall change my opinion as often as I find it appropriate or profitable. As to Lygia, her royal descent is more certain than Acte’s. But in Antium be on thy guard against Poppaea, who is revengeful.”</p>
			<p>“I do not think of doing so. A hair will not fall from my head in Antium.”</p>
			<p>“If thou think to astonish me a second time, thou art mistaken; but whence hast thou that certainty?”</p>
			<p>“The Apostle Peter told me so.”</p>
			<p>“Ah, the Apostle Peter told thee! Against that there is no argument; permit me, however, to take certain measures of precaution even to this end, that the Apostle Peter may not turn out a false prophet; for, should the Apostle be mistaken, perchance he might lose thy confidence, which certainly will be of use to him in the future.”</p>
			<p>“Do what may please thee, but I believe him. And if thou think to turn me against him by repeating his name with irony, thou art mistaken.”</p>
			<p>“But one question more. Hast thou become a Christian?”</p>
			<p>“Not yet; but Paul of Tarsus will travel with me to explain the teachings of Christ, and afterward I will receive baptism; for thy statement that they are enemies of life and pleasantness is not true.”</p>
			<p>“All the better for thee and Lygia,” answered Petronius; then, shrugging his shoulders, he said, as if to himself, “But it is astonishing how skilled those people are in gaining adherents, and how that sect is extending.”</p>
			<p>“Yes,” answered Vinicius, with as much warmth as if he had been baptized already; “there are thousands and tens of thousands of them in Rome, in the cities of Italy, in Greece and Asia. There are Christians among the legions and among the pretorians; they are in the palace of Caesar itself. Slaves and citizens, poor and rich, plebeian and patrician, confess that faith. Dost thou know that the Cornelii are Christians, that Pomponia Graecina is a Christian, that likely Octavia was, and Acte is? Yes, that teaching will embrace the world, and it alone is able to renew it. Do not shrug thy shoulders, for who knows whether in a month or a year thou wilt not receive it thyself?”</p>
			<p>“I?” said Petronius. “No, by the son of Leto! I will not receive it; even if the truth and wisdom of gods and men were contained in it. That would require labor, and I have no fondness for labor. Labor demands self-denial, and I will not deny myself anything. With thy nature, which is like fire and boiling water, something like this may happen any time. But I? I have my gems, my cameos, my vases, my Eunice. I do not believe in Olympus, but I arrange it on earth for myself; and I shall flourish till the arrows of the divine archer pierce me, or till Caesar commands me to open my veins. I love the odor of violets too much, and a comfortable triclinium. I love even our gods, as rhetorical figures, and Achaea, to which I am preparing to go with our fat, thin-legged, incomparable, godlike Caesar, the august period-compelling Hercules, Nero.”</p>
			<p>Then he was joyous at the very supposition that he could accept the teaching of Galilean fishermen, and began to sing in an undertone⁠—</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
				<p>
					<span>“I will entwine my bright sword in myrtle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After the example of Harmodius and Aristogeiton.”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>But he stopped, for the arrival of Eunice was announced. Immediately after her coming supper was served, during which songs were sung by the cithara players; Vinicius told of Chilo’s visit, and also how that visit had given the idea of going to the Apostles directly⁠—an idea which came to him while they were flogging Chilo.</p>
			<p>At mention of this, Petronius, who began to be drowsy, placed his hand on his forehead, and said⁠—“The thought was good, since the object was good. But as to Chilo, I should have given him five pieces of gold; but as it was thy will to flog him, it was better to flog him, for who knows but in time senators will bow to him, as today they are bowing to our cobbler-knight, Vatinius. Good night.”</p>
			<p>And, removing his wreath, he, with Eunice, prepared for home. When they had gone, Vinicius went to his library and wrote to Lygia as follows:⁠—</p>
			<p>“When thou openest thy beautiful eyes, I wish this letter to say Good day! to thee. Hence I write now, though I shall see thee tomorrow. Caesar will go to Antium after tomorrow⁠—and I, <i xml:lang="la">eheu</i>! must go with him. I have told thee already that not to obey would be to risk life⁠—and at present I could not find courage to die. But if thou wish me not to go, write one word, and I will stay. Petronius will turn away danger from me with a speech. Today, in the hour of my delight, I gave rewards to all my slaves; those who have served in the house twenty years I shall take to the pretor tomorrow and free. Thou, my dear, shouldst praise me, since this act as I think will be in accord with that mild religion of thine; secondly, I do this for thy sake. They are to thank thee for their freedom. I shall tell them so tomorrow, so that they may be grateful to thee and praise thy name. I give myself in bondage to happiness and thee. God grant that I never see liberation. May Antium be cursed, and the journey of Ahenobarbus! Thrice and four times happy am I in not being so wise as Petronius; if I were, I should be forced to go to Greece perhaps. Meanwhile the moment of separation will sweeten my memory of thee. Whenever I can tear myself away, I shall sit on a horse, and rush back to Rome, to gladden my eyes with sight of thee, and my ears with thy voice. When I cannot come I shall send a slave with a letter, and an inquiry about thee. I salute thee, divine one, and embrace thy feet. Be not angry that I call thee divine. If thou forbid, I shall obey, but today I cannot call thee otherwise. I congratulate thee on thy future house with my whole soul.”</p>
